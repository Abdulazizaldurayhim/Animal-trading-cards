			<p>Megalodon was not only the biggest shark in the world, but one of the largest fish ever to exist.
				Estimates suggest it grew to between 15 and 18 meters in length, three times longer than the largest recorded great white shark. These size can tell us a lot such as what these massive animals ate.
				With its large teeth megalodon would have eaten-most likely whales and large fish, and probably other sharks
